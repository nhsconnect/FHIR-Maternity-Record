## Introduction ##

The PRSB has produced a standard for [maternity care records](https://theprsb.org/standards/maternityrecord), which will mean that information from a record can be understood by all IT systems in use across the country, enabling the seamless exchange of information regardless of local maternity system boundary.

Standardised records will save time for health and care professionals and pregnant women by ensuring they have the necessary information in the right place at the right time, to make decisions for safer care. It will also support mothers in managing their own maternity information, giving them more personalised and focussed appointments with healthcare professionals and helping midwives and clinicians to provide holistic care.

Developed and supported by midwives, clinicians and other professionals, the work was conducted in partnership with the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) Health Informatics Unit (HIU).

## [INTEROPen](http://www.interopen.org)
FHIR Messaging components specified within this site have been developed by NHS Digital and use CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the INTEROPen community. 

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.

See [CareConnect FHIR Profiles](support_careconnect.html) for further clarification on the use of CareConnect FHIR profiles within this specification.

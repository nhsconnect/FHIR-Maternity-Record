summary: "The FHIR profiles used for the Allergies and Adverse Reactions list"
---

## Heading Description ##
The details of any known allergies, intolerances or adverse reactions.

The following FHIR profiles are used to form the Allergies and reactions list structure:

- [CareConnect-List-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-List-1)
- [CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-AllergyIntolerance-1)

The following profiles are referenced from the Allergies and reactions list structure:

- [CareConnect-Patient-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Patient-1)
